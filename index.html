  <h3><b>Biography</b></h3>
<p>He was born on the 7 February 1952, also known mononymously as Vasco or with the nickname Il Blasco, is an Italian singer-songwriter and poet. 
During his career, he has published 30 albums and has written over 250 songs(also lyrics for other artists).

Rossi calls himself a provocautore as throughout his career he has been regularly criticized over his choice of lifestyle and the lyrics in his songs. With more than 35 millions of copies sold, he is one of the best-selling Italian singers. His Modena Park 2017 concert is the highest-attended ticketed concert of all time.</p>

  <h3><b>Early life</b></h3>
<p>Born in Zocca,province of Modena (Emilia-Romagna). His father, Carlo Rossi(truck-driver) and his mother, Novella(a housewife). His mother decided to enroll him in singing school when he was young. Nonetheless, Rossi fell in love with music and at the age of 14 began playing with his first band.

Rossi and his family moved to Bologna, Italy, where he studied accounting in high school. Upon graduating he opened a music club, Punto Club, and enrolled in university at the faculty of Economics and Business. In the meantime he supported himself by working as a DJ and founding, along with friends, one of the first private radio stations in Italy, "Punto Radio", with which he began slowly and timidly showcasing his own songs.</p>

  <h3><b>Musical career</b></h3>
<p>Encouraged by his friend Gaetano Curreri, Rossi released his first EP on 13 June 1977, which included the songs "Jenny Ã¨ pazza" and "Silvia", and a full-length album in 1978, Ma cosa vuoi che sia una canzone. In 1979, he released a second album, Non siamo mica gli americani, which included, "Albachiara", one of his biggest hits, a ballad considered emblematic of Rossi's poetic style. His most controversial album, Colpa d'Alfredo  followed in 1980; many journalist's called him a drug addict. Rossi argued that evidently they did not understand his music and remarked how easy it is to criticize a still unknown artist who cannot defend himself.

In 1981, the album Siamo solo noi was released.

In 1982, Rossi took part for the first time in the Sanremo Music Festival, performing the song "Vado al massimo". Here, he once again found himself under harsh criticism, and came in last place in the festival. In April of the same year the album Vado al Massimo was released. The following year, he reappeared at the Sanremo Music Festival, this time performing "Vita spericolata". The following album, Bollicine, published in 1983, was his sixth in seven years, and was the album that consecrated him definitively as an idol of the new generation and an icon of Italian rock. The title track, whose lyrics are about Coke (but also demonstrate a clear assonance with cocaine), won the Festivalbar '83, and his tour that year was an enormous success.</p>
<p>As he sang in one of his famous songs ("Voglio una vita spericolata"), Vasco has never been an easy person, rebellious and with a great desire to express his creative vein.</p>
